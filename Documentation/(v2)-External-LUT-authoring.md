The color grading effect has been improved a lot in v2. One of its new feature is the ability to author 3D LUTs in external DCC tools like Adobe's Photoshop, DaVinci's Resolve, The Foundry's Nuke etc and import CUBE LUTs straight into Unity.

This feature requires support for Texture3D and compute shaders.

This guide won't go over color grading theory so you should already be familiar with at least one of the softwares in this guide. We'll only focus on the proper setup for creating CUBEs in external software (with sRGB displays as target), importing & using them into Unity.
