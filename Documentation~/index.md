## Post-Processing Stack v2 overview

**Post-processing** is the process of applying full-screen filters and effects to a cameraâ€™s image buffer before it is displayed to screen. It can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time.

You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties.

For information about requirements and compatibility, see section [Requirements](requirements.html).

The images below demonstrate a scene with and without post-processing.
