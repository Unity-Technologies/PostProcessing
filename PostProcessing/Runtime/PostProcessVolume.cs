    //
    // Here's a quick look at the architecture of this framework and how it's integrated into Unity
    // (written between versions 5.6 and 2017.1):
    //
    // Users have to be able to plug in their own effects without having to modify the codebase and
    // these custom effects should work out-of-the-box with all the other features we provide
    // (volume blending etc). This relies on heavy use of polymorphism, but the only way to get
    // the serialization system to work well with polymorphism in Unity is to use ScriptableObjects.
    //
    // Users can push their custom effects at different (hardcoded) injection points.
    //
    // Each effect consists of at least two classes (+ shaders): a POD "Settings" class which only
    // stores parameters, and a "Renderer" class that holds the rendering logic. Settings are linked
    // to renderers using a PostProcessAttribute. These are automatically collected at init time
    // using reflection. Settings in this case are ScriptableObjects, we only need to serialize
    // these.
    //
    // We could store these settings object straight into each volume and call it a day, but
    // unfortunately there's one feature of Unity that doesn't work well with scene-stored assets:
    // prefabs. So we need to store all of these settings in a disk-asset and treat them as
    // sub-assets.
    //
    // Note: We have to use ScriptableObject for everything but these don't work with the Animator
    //       tool. It's unfortunate but it's the only way to make it easily extensible. On the other
    //       hand, users can animate post-processing effects using Volumes or straight up scripting.
    //
    // Volume blending leverages the physics system for distance checks to the nearest point on
    // volume colliders. Each volume can have several colliders or any type (cube, mesh...), making
    // it quite a powerful feature to use.
    //
    // Volumes & blending are handled by a singleton manager (see PostProcessManager).
    //
    // Rendering is handled by a PostProcessLayer component living on the camera, which mean you
    // can easily toggle post-processing on & off or change the anti-aliasing type per-camera,
    // which is very useful when doing multi-layered camera rendering or any other technique that
    // involves multiple-camera setups. This PostProcessLayer component can also filters volumes
    // by layers (as in Unity layers) so you can easily choose which volumes should affect the
    // camera.
    //
    // All post-processing shaders MUST use the custom Standard Shader Library bundled with the
    // framework. The reason for that is because the codebase is meant to work without any
    // modification on the Classic Render Pipelines (Forward, Deferred...) and the upcoming
    // Scriptable Render Pipelines (HDPipe, LDPipe...). But these don't have compatible shader
    // libraries so instead of writing two code paths we chose to provide a minimalist, generic
    // Standard Library geared toward post-processing use. An added bonus to that if users create
    // their own post-processing effects using this framework, then they'll work without any
    // modification on both Classic and Scriptable Render Pipelines.
    //
